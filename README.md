I am a driven and ambitious professional with around 3 years of experience in the telecom industry. Recently, I have decided to transition my career into the exciting world of cloud computing, with a focus on DevOps.

Although I don't have direct professional experience in the cloud/DevOps field yet, I have been diligently learning and exploring the AWS cloud platform since July 2023. I am deeply passionate about this domain and fascinated by its ability to revolutionize modern software development and infrastructure management.

Equipped with a strong foundation in the telecom industry and a keen interest in cloud computing, I am eager to leverage my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and commitment to continuous learning to drive meaningful impact within the dynamic cloud and DevOps landscape.
